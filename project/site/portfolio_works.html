	<div class=”work-image”><a href="img/ardentroyalguard.png" data-lightbox="photo" data-title="Ardent Royal Guard."><img src="img/thumb_royalguard.png" alt="royalguard"></a></div>
<div class=”work-text”>

<h2>Ardent Royal Guard</h2>

<p>This is a member of Hetzaria's Ardent Royal Guards, sworn protectors of the Imperator/Imperatrix. Outfitted with the highest quality armor crafted from cutting-edge technology. Rigorously trained in the Royal Academy and receiving mechanical augmentations, they guard the Throne Room of the Regis Bastion alongside the Royal Defense Corps. </p>
	<div class=”work-image”><a href="img/foxtailEGO.png" data-lightbox="photo" data-title="Foxtail's EGO."><img src="img/thumb_foxtail.png" alt="foxtail"></a></div>
<div class=”work-text”>

<h2>Foxtail's E.G.O</h2>

<p>This is an illustration of the character "Foxtail" from Mr. Staleman's work, "Rat King." Specifically, Foxtail with her unlocked E.G.O from Chapter 24, her motif is a wraithly knight with a rainbow-prism rapier. Permission was granted by the author himself.</p>
	<div class=”work-image”><a href="img/greenordeal.png" data-lightbox="photo" data-title="Green Ordeal."><img src="img/thumb_ordeal.png" alt="greenordeal"></a></div>
<div class=”work-text”>

<h2>Green Ordeal</h2>

<p>This is an imagination of what place the Green Ordeal machines from Lobotomy Corporation would have originated from. A vast wasteland with scattered towers emitting green lasers into the sky, while robots of war wander the land without purpose.</p>
	<div class=”work-image”><a href="img/misakicarnet.png" data-lightbox="photo" data-title="Misaki Carnet."><img src="img/thumb_misakicarnet.png" alt="misakicarnet"></a></div>
<div class=”work-text”>

<h2>Misaki Carnet</h2>

<p>One of my characters from Hetzaria, Misaki Carnet. She is a Corporal of the elite R-Regiment of the Imperial Military, noted for being sassy and playful, she uses the Eviscerator-Type Corpus and serves as the role of Medic/Interrogator. Her code name is "Banshee."</p>
	<div class=”work-image”><a href="img/singingmachine.png" data-lightbox="photo" data-title="Singing Machine."><img src="img/thumb_singing.png" alt="singingmachine"></a></div>
<div class=”work-text”>

<h2>Singing Machine</h2>

<p>An employee addicted to the music from the Abnormality known as "Singing Machine." Those entranced by the song have dilated pupils, with a yellow glow and a wicked grin. They will often try to find ways to keep the music going and force others to listen to its tune. These are from the game Lobotomy Corporation.</p>
	<div class=”work-image”><a href="img/theheadwatches.png" data-lightbox="photo" data-title="The Head Watches."><img src="img/thumb_thehead.png" alt="headwatches"></a></div>
<div class=”work-text”>

<h2>The Head Watches</h2>

<p>A depiction of several members of the "Head" from the game, Library of Ruina. Having an authoritarian rule over the City, they survey the entirety of the urban complex, rooting out any dissent and seizing forbidden technology with deadly force. They ultilize modified soldiers and psychic assassins to carry out judgement.</p>
	<div class=”work-image”><a href="img/hanagetsasoda.png" data-lightbox="photo" data-title="Hana gets a soda."><img src="img/thumb_hana.png" alt="hana"></a></div>
<div class=”work-text”>

<h2>Hana gets a Soda</h2>

<p>My original created characters from the game Library of Ruina. They are Hana, Mary, and Morrigan, Librarians of the Floor of Art. Here they are taking some of Netzach's drink stashes for themselves. The Art Librarians are often noted for being lazy and drunk most of the time, but they are efficient when they want to be.</p>
	<div class=”work-image”><a href="img/beyondtheoutskirts.png" data-lightbox="photo" data-title="Beyond the Outskirts."><img src="img/thumb_outskirts.png" alt="outskirts"></a></div>
<div class=”work-text”>

<h2>Beyond the Outskirts</h2>

<p>My depiction of what some of the Outskirts would look like from Library of Ruina. Considering the game doesn't show much of what the wasteland looks like, I decided on an endless desert filled with destroyed ruins of cities, with ragged tents and camps dotting the landscape.</p>
	<div class=”work-image”><a href="img/ardentofficer.png" data-lightbox="photo" data-title="Ardent Royal Officer."><img src="img/thumb_royalofficer.png" alt="royalofficer"></a></div>
<div class=”work-text”>

<h2>Ardent Royal Officer</h2>

<p>A member of the Ardent Royal Guards, an Officer. They serve as advisors and strategists for the more combat-oriented Guards, however, they are just as capable in battle, using quick and decisive movements to strike down opponents. Considering this is my first illustration, I will likely change it in the future, as I'm not quite satisfied with it.</p>
	<div class=”work-image”><a href="img/isadoraofzwei.png" data-lightbox="photo" data-title="Isadora of Zwei."><img src="img/thumb_zwei.png" alt="zwei"></a></div>
<div class=”work-text”>

<h2>Isadora of Zwei</h2>

<p>Two members of Zwei Association from Library of Ruina, the blonde one is unamed, while the black-haired one is Isadora. Zwei Association is a peacekeeping organization that defends it's clients from crazed murderers and thugs in the Backstreets. However, one must have the proper funds to afford their services. They ultilize Zweihander greatswords in combat.</p>
	<div class=”work-image”><a href="img/backstreetbutchers.png" data-lightbox="photo" data-title="Backstreet Butchers."><img src="img/thumb_butchers.png" alt="butchers"></a></div>
<div class=”work-text”>

<h2>Backstreet Butchers</h2>

<p>These are Butchers of District 23 from Library of Ruina. District 23 is infamous for its acceptance of cannibalism as the "perfect ingredient in cooking", most citizens are often plucked from the streets and cooked alive to be served to the wealthy in bistros and restaurants. Those originating from here often have a tolerance towards replusive things as a result of the horrors.</p>
	<div class=”work-image”><a href="img/roguehunter.png" data-lightbox="photo" data-title="Rogue Hunter."><img src="img/thumb_hunter.png" alt="hunter"></a></div>
<div class=”work-text”>

<h2>Rogue Hunter</h2>

<p>This is my original Hunter from the game Tom Clancy's The Division 2. Hunters are mysterious enemies that players can encounter by performing certain actions at night, they are extremely dangerous and brutal in their dealings with their foes. They often wear a black ballistic mask and heavy armor, with watches from fallen agents by their hand as trophies.</p>
	<div class=”work-image”><a href="img/sweepers.png" data-lightbox="photo" data-title="Sweepers."><img src="img/thumb_sweepers.png" alt="sweepers"></a></div>
<div class=”work-text”>

<h2>Sweepers</h2>

<p>These are Sweepers from Library of Ruina. They are specially modified humans encased in a suit that turns all their flesh to goo, they sustain themselves by siphoning flesh from other humans with special hooks. Hordes of them emerge in the City at night to sweep anything that dared stayed outside.</p>
	<div class=”work-image”><a href="img/silentbygone.png" data-lightbox="photo" data-title="Silent Bygone."><img src="img/thumb_bygone.png" alt="bygone"></a></div>
<div class=”work-text”>

<h2>Silent Bygone</h2>

<p>This is the Distorted form of a certain character from Library of Ruina. Fought at the end of the game's story, this character unleashes all the sorrow and rage that pent up inside of them during their journey, manifesting it in a dramatic and hideous manner.</p>
